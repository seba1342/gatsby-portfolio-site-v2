This project was built in response to a brief which required us to build a 'how-to' guide - with the medium and content being upto us.

I had just listened to the [Matthew Walker & Joe Rogan Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig) (which I highly recommend!) so I was inspired to share some knowledge I gained from this podcast.
This was my first time using a wacom tablet to make illustrations and it was a fun little process. I think the hand drawn illustrations add a nice effect and the animations elevate it to that next level.
I also played around with parallax scrolling effects on images, which was a new experience for me.

I hope people will find this guide resourceful, because it was great fun to make! You can see it live at <https://howtosleep.bailouni.com>
