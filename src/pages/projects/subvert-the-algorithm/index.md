This project is a part of my Design Graduation Show (<https://www.monash.edu/mada/events/mada-now-2019>).

It is a response to the world of algorithms that we live in. It attempts to raise awareness about how algorithms curate all the content we consume online.
I hope that you can get something out of this website.

Have a look at it here: <https://subvert-the-algorithm.com>.
