This was a great project to work on. Part tester, part showcase, part eCommerce store.
This site was built using React, Gatsby and the Shopify API. This combo creates a
lightning quick site, with no need to manage the payments portal, fulfillment process or
product management. The CMS for this site is done through Shopify, but to take it even
further the next step is to integrate it into a custom CMS hosted by <https://netlify.com>.

We also received an [honourable mention](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/lambfcm) and a
[mobile excellence award](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/lambfcm/mobile-excellence-report) from awwwards.
This was a great experience and I cannot wait to make more sites that people enjoy to use.
