I took over where the legendary [Dan Courtness](https://courtness.netlify.com) left off. After the migration from Wordpress to Gatsby for Black Friday sales, the Fluff gals wanted to ensure their vision was clear. I worked on adding a way to encourage people to refill and reuse their products in an engaging way. You can see this in action if you head to <https://www.itsallfluff.com/products/lip-oil-1-clear/> and add the item to your cart. Alongside your cart you will be presented with an option to add refills of this product.

I also worked across the CMS handover and ensured the Fluff gals could create, edit and delete products in a staging environment before moving it onto their production site.
