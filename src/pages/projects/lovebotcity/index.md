Love Bot City is a generative art piece that explores the relationship between space and social processes.
This project was built while studying the unit Creative Computing in Prato, Italy.
We had five days to ideate, design and develop a project that encapsulated our time studying and experiencing Prato.

Working closely with [Kal](https://www.instagram.com/kalanabanana/), [Jon](https://www.instagram.com/vrankul/) and [Wil](https://www.instagram.com/wont_johnston/) we created lovebotcity.
Using [pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) we were able to draw a minimal representation of how cities grow organically.
The inspiration for the idea came while high above the city of Lucca, where the rigid grid of roads and houses were surrounded by a sparatic layout.
