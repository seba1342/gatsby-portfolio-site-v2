This project was tasked to us by <http://u-p.co> (Uriah) during the unit Digital Publishing. You can see the project brief at <http://dpub.u-p.co/projects/lan3000>.

TLDR; This site has been developed as a part of a network of user-run public websites for public good. Have a look at the others at <http://openforpublic.com>.

This project was my first using <https://threejs.org>, which is a great 3d library. Open up any of the book pages and have a look at how the 3d model is
controlled by your mouse movements.

Have a look at it here: <https://selfhelpbooks.club>.
