This website is for the photographer JB Photohouse. He runs photography tours around Victoria and wanted a way for people to see more information about the tour and book a spot.

This site uses Netlify CMS so the client can manage the content all by themselves. It's also hosted on Netlify and is built using GatsbyJS.

You can see it live and book a photography tour at <https://jbphotohouse.com.au>
