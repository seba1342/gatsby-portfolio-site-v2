With this project I wanted to digitise my family tree. The original, which is still somewhere in Syria, was a small photograph which had all the information in Arabic.
With this image I worked with my Grandpa to translate and decipher the family tree into English.

Unfortunately it doesn't show the children/families of the females in the family. However, I have begun to include those that we know in an attempt to preserve as much as possible.

I hope this can be continued on for years to come. Have a look at <https://bailouni.com>
