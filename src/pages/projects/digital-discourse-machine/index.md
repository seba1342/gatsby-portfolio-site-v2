Digital Discoure Machine is a project which explores past and present ways of communicating love.
Old love letters were sourced online for content and the handwriting was imposed ontop of a modern day iMessage conversation.

I noticed while reading these converted love letters that I began to shudder, yet this did not happen while I was reading them in their original form.
I think has something to do with the emojis. I do know that it is cringey though.

This was a good project to introduce me to [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) (which is also what I am using for this website). I liked playing around with the tags used to filter the letters and [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) makes this super easy.
